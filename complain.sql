He sent all documents in his name through whatsapp although the profile picture of the app shows a different person than the photo ID and he said he would send me the advance amount of rent and will stay from 22nd August 2021 in my said flat.\r\n\r\nBut, finally in the evening when he asked me to send Rs. 1 to his account from google pay so that I would be registered under Indian Army\'s bank beneficiary, I got confused and doubted his activity since he gave the account number of IDFC bank which I could not trust upon. Then I disconnected the call and searched for his information on social media and google and found that this man has been cheating people for a couple of months using one Indian Army\'s ID proof and name.\r\n\r\nThough I did not lose anything but many had so, I humbly request you to look into this matter seriously as this is defaming the name of such an Honorable department which gives protection to the country instead of such fraudulence. \r\n\r\nI am attaching the screenshot of our discussion and his ID proof that he submitted for your reference.\r\n\r\n--\r\nPampa Chakraborty\r\nPh. +918895484966 and +919874820369\r\n\r\n--\r\nPampa Chakraborty\r\nPh. +919874820369',NULL,NULL,'2021-08-20','12:28:00','pampachakraborty654@gmail.com; ',10,'Because of no monitory loss we advised to lodge complaint to respective local Police Station.','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:1:{i:0;s:35:\"Letter send to the intermediataries\";}','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,'2021-08-25',NULL,'2022-01-20 18:47:00',1,45),(3,'eMail','',18,'','Kindly note that sometime in the first week of August 2021 I ordered Table Lamp from Myntra.

In 2015 I created a facebook profile and was using it. Plenty of my personal photos were there and I have so many friends there. But somehow I forgot the login credential of that said profile and couldn\'t remember or recover it so I created a new profile and started using it.\r\nBut this year on 28th April 2021 I found a post in my facebook timeline stating that Ritu Das got married to Abhishek Mukherjee. The post draws my attention as my husband\'s name is also Abhishek Mukherjee, so I visited that Ritu Das profile and found that it was that profile which I mentioned earlier and saw some of my recent personal photos were also there which must be copied from my current profile. So I suspected that my current profile also got hacked so I took necessary security measures and started looking at Ritu Das profile. Then I noticed that profile name also changed to Ritu Das Mukherjee and realised that someone got access to my old forgotten profile\'s login credential and started disturbing me purposefully and it came true. That person started making posts using my personal photos and tagging my friends.\r\nSo firstly I made a facebook post from my present profile stating the entire matter and tagged Kolkata Police.\r\nThen on 29th April 2021 lodged a general diary at Serampore Police Station vide G.D.E. No. 1424 dated 29-04-2021 and the officer advised me to visit the Cyber Crime Cell at Chuchura to get more help in this matter. Then on 1st May 2021 I visited there and told the concerned officer the entire matter. She took my case and assured me that the profile will be blocked within 72 hours. The next day I found that the profile isn\'t available anymore on facebook so I felt that the problem was over.\r\nBut on 21st June 2021 that profile again becomes live. As LOCKDOWN was running, so I called Cyber Crime Cell Chuchura and informed them of the matter. For my luck the lady officer, who took my case when I visited there, answered my call and assured me that the profile will be blocked again and yes the profile got blocked on the next day.\r\nThen I started to keep an eye on that profile on a regular basis and it wasn\'t visible anymore.\r\nBut today, the 29th August 2021 morning I found the profile is active again. So without wasting time I called up the Cyber Crime Cell Chuchura and informed them of the matter. The officer who answered my call assured me that the profile will be blocked within 72 hours.\r\nNow my concern is why this profile is getting active again and again after getting blocked. I am feeling annoyed by this type of identity threat. Whoever is using this profile can do anything serious using this profile and I will be in serious trouble as once the profile belongs to me and my address is also there.\r\nI would like to request that if there is any permanent solution to de-activate this profile, please let me know.\r\nLink of the said profile: https://www.facebook.com/ritu.das.39142072\r\nMy present profile link: https://www.facebook.com/ritudas511\r\nPlease take necessary action asap in this matter.\r\nA Copy of the GD is attached with this email for your reference.\r\nBest regards,\r\nRitu Das\r\n3/87, Mahesh Colony\r\nSerampore - 712202\r\nHooghly\r\nWest Bengal\r\nMobile: 9163162878, 7439884064',NULL,NULL,'2021-08-29','22:14:00','dritu878@gmail.com; ',7,'She already complaint at Cyber Crime Cell at Chuchura and the matter look after by them.','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:1:{i:0;s:38:\"Outside of Kolkata Police Jurisdiction\";}','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2021-08-30 09:21:00',1,45),(58,'Written','CYBER PS, KOLKATA LP NO-947/21 DT. 30-08-2021',23,'An unwanted online Ransomware attack and YouTube  & Google Account been hacked.

But due to a lockdown the hotel was closed permanently. So I was desperately trying to get a new job to run my family expenses.\r\n\r\nOn 31st July 2021 I registered myself with Shine.com (job search portal) to get a new job and paid Rs. 2,005/- through online on the same date, as per their Proforma Invoice [as per Annexure – I is being enclosed herewith]. This payment has been made through my credit card. Then I received many job offers via SMS on my registered mobile number 9830069528.\r\n\r\nOne of the SMS of 8th July 2021 was as follows :-\r\n“Congratulations your CV is selected for BANDHAN BANK-DATA ENTRY BACK OFFICE, salary 22k/75k. For more info 7001403197 sent via shine.com”\r\n\r\nOn 8th August, 2021 I called mobile no 7001403197 (as per Truecaller-Bandhan Bank- Identified as Caller No 1) while receiver of this phone has asked me to submit my Resume along with the related supporting documents on his WhatsApp Number (same as above) and accordingly I had done the same through WhatsApp on the same number. Then he asked me to pay Rs. 300/- as application money via NEFT to the beneficiary SUBHRAYATI SEN, S/B Account No. 2149038861, IFSC – CBIN0282013 through NEFT. Accordingly I paid Rs. 300/- by NEFT same day [as per Annexure–II is being enclosed herewith]. On receiving my application fees, he sent me a link (https://globalpvtltd.online) via WhatsApp and advised me to register profile details online. I have successfully registered myself on this portal. Hereafter he informed me to appear for the Online Exam on 9th August 2021 at 14:10 PM.\r\n\r\nOn 9th August, 2021 I appeared the online exam and successfully obtained pass mark as per their Merit List, published next day vide my Roll Number 232091 [as per Annexure-III is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 11th August, 2021 another caller, number 9339409313 (as per Truecaller–Sayan Banerjee- Identified as Caller No 2) informed me that I have selected as per Merit List, published in the Website and advised me to pay Rs. 3,250/- as security deposit, which is refundable after joining the service at bank. He also informed me that after payment of the security deposit, I shall get a confirmation letter. Accordingly I have paid Rs. 3,250/- via NEFT on the same day [as per Annexure-IV is enclosed herewith]. They also sent me a Confirmation Letter from their registered email id : career.globalcentral.online, and advised me to resubmit the same duly signed. I have submitted the same with return mail [as per Annexure-V is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 13th August 2021 another caller, number 9432689228 (as per TrueCaller-Bandhan Bank Raj Deep Sen-Identified as Caller no 3) asked me to pay Rs. 15,800/- towards Health Insurance premium to get Appointment letter, otherwise candidature will be cancelled. I refused to pay that amount and informed that person to cancel my candidature and I also requested to refund my money back. The person assured me over phone that the entire money will be refunded within the next 3 days.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, again I got a call from Sayan Banerjee (Caller No 2 as referred above) asked me that they have reconsidered the premium at Rs. 5,200/- only and pay immediately to get Appointment letter. He also promised and assured me no need to pay any more Amount. Unfortunately, I have paid Rs. 5,200/- to the same beneficiary on faith according to his assurance [as per Annexure-VI is enclosed herewith]. Hereinafter, I got Appointment letter through their registered email (career.globalcentral.online) from Bandhan Bank on their letterhead “Bandhan Bank 66/2, Ground Floor, Ward No. 22, Dumdum Road, Dist. South Dumdum, West Bengal – 700014” [as per Annexure-VII is enclosed herewith].\r\n\r\nOn 14th August, 2021 again I got a call from mobile number 9339409313 from Sayan Banerjee (Caller No 2 as referred above) and he asked me to pay the balance amount Rs. 10,600/- to get a joining letter. Sir, at this moment I immediately informed that I am unable to pay any further amount and also asked him to refund all the amount paid by me. The caller No 2 Sayan Banerjee told me to get a refund.

The  Bank clearly stated that is completely false as there is no such system of employment in their bank and Bank advised me to file FIR at the local PS or file a Complaint at the Cyber Crime Department, Lalbazar directly.\r\n\r\nSir, I am the most victimised person of this fully fraud people who are cheating my hard earned money.

Till now from the last 18 months I am unemployed and looking for job, for that I have uploaded my resume in various job sites and trying hard to get any luck.\r\n\r\nIn this regard on 10th of June I got a call from a person named Shantanu claiming he is from GBIC Services PVT LTD and he asked me whether I am looking for a job and I said yes. Then he asked me about my educational qualification and experience and offered me a job in Netherlands for a company called Glomar Offshore BV saying in July you will face the interview once you will be shortlisted by the client. Before send your cv and documents to our mail id which I did. Then after some days Shantanu said ok your cv is selected and your interview will be conducted on this date. I got an interview call from an Netherlands no +3197005035152, a lady claiming to be the HR of Glomar Offshore took my interview and she had good idea about my job and after successful interview she offered me the salary and all. Then I got the selection mail from Glomar offshore on 06/08/2021 (attached) and they asked me to submit documents for verification like education, experience certificates, passport copy etc. I gave and after some day on 20/08/2021 I got the contract letter in which they had written like due to covid terms candidate had to do PCC, medicals, travel insurance, visa stamping and return tickets to Amsterdam and this will be reimbursed once I will submit my NRI account. For this reason I did not doubted them and paid for all the expenses knowing company will reimburse everything. In this time I sent them 20,000 + 20,000 + 42,855 + 20,000 = 102855 in the account number they sent me. I was getting mails from mail@hrglomaroffshore.com and I was getting instructions what to do, first they said proceed with PCC for Netherlands , and then proceed with DG Shipping ILO medical and I did my medicals too. Then they asked to do travel and visa stamping and then return ticket of Kolkata to Amsterdam from GBIC services and send the screenshot of transactions to them as bill/receipt so that later on they will reimburse in my NRI account.\r\n\r\nI was hesitant in paying travel tickets because I had no money, I borrowed from my friends and paid to them. In mail they said I will get my flight PNR and visa letter on 28/08/2021. Shantanu said once you get the visa letter you can open NRI account on the same day and your money will be transferred same day from the company and he also told me to do notary of the documents once I get the visa letter and after notary I will have to go to Mumbai for visa stamping, for which they said my slot has been booked on 06/09/2021 in VFS Global Mumbai.\r\n\r\nMy last payment to shantanu was on 25/08/2021 after that he was not replying to my whatsapp and not taking calls.\r\n\r\nOn 28/08/2021 Shantanu deleted his whatsapp account and switched off his phone. GBIC website had 4 contact numbers and all was switched off. The mail id ( mail@glomaroffshore.com) was also deleted and when I mailed about the status of my visa I got a reply from gmail that this mail ID does not exist or unable to receive your mail. From that day phone no are switch off. They ran away with my money.

Since I did not have a GPay account I requested my brother to receive the money from Sanjay Singh on my behalf and transfer it to me later. \r\nHe claimed to be an army officer and said that he needed a security amount of half of the sum of money where after he could send us the total amount. My brother paid him a sum of Rs 49,000. It has been debited from my brother, Ananga Roy Choudhury\'s account to Sanjay Singh in promise of getting Rs 1 lakh. There after we have not been able to get back our debited sum of Rs 49,000. The money was sent through 2 transactions of Rs 24,500 each through GPay at 3:26pm and 3:33pm.

That the fact of the matter is that in recent past the undersigned has been vociferously\r\nappealing against the atrocities committed by the O/C Nabadwip Police Station as well\r\nas the support given to the O/C by the SP, Nadia District. The said O/C committed\r\nmass human rights violation by firstly aiding the local goons of TMCP in order to\r\ncommit nefarious activities against poor victims and also for not taking any action\r\nagainst the accused persons in another rape case where action was the need of the \r\nhour. The said Police Officials have not taken action wherever it was needed and where\r\nthere was no action needed to be taken the said O/C took harsh and unsubstantiated\r\naction against poor victims which warrants vociferous appeal from my side as wherever\r\nthere is a human rights violation, I have to take cognizance of the same. One such case\r\nwhere the O/C and SP took no action was the gang rape committed upon a 13-14 year\r\nold minor girl and the O/C’s inaction in arresting all the accused persons due to which\r\nthey were roaming around scot-free. In this regard I uploaded a facebook post on the\r\nlast day where I alleged about such mass human rights violation being committed upon\r\nthe poor minor girl. I tagged the CP, Kolkata Police and as soon as I tagged the O/C and\r\nthe SP in that post, the post got deleted and my account has been restricted for a\r\ncouple of days which clearly shows that my account has been hacked/misused through\r\nthe active intervention of the O/C and SP and there is enough chain of circumstances\r\nto substantiate my point.\r\nHence it is prayed before your good self so that this information is accepted and investigation\r\ncommences in order to unearth the truth and remove my apprehensions about the active\r\nintervention of two Police Officials in order to harass a Human Rights Defender who work for\r\nthe people.\r\nIt is also to be noted that due to the ongoing nation-wide lockdown to curtail the impact of\r\nCOVID-19, this complain is sent through electronic mail (e-mail), once this ongoing lockdown\r\nis lifted a copy of this complain along with all the necessary enclosures shall be sent by post\r\nto the office of your goodself.

To my horror, I received communication from my friends and other mutual friends who showed that they have received WhatsApp messages from my account, wherein I was allegedly making statements which maligned me and harmed my self interest. Further, such messages, if exhibited will influence the proceedings in my wife\'s favour and will serve her purpose. I am horrified and shell-shocked as I have not made any such\r\n\r\nmessage\'s nor have I typed such messages to the concerned persons.\r\n\r\nOn checking my phone minutely, I found that WhatsApp Web was used and an unknown device had logged into my account from a Google Chrome Browser, running on a Linux Operating System and such service was used at 7.32 pm on 05.01.2022, which coincides with the time I noticed the glitch and the time of the messages being sent.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the abovenamed person with the active aid of other unknown persons have hacked into my phone and WhatsApp account in order to manipulate the software and send such messages which may injure my reputation and taking into account the nature of the messages, the abovenamed person stands to gain from such hacking and manipulation of software of my phone.\r\n\r\nThus, I am constrained to urge upon your good office to treat this letter of complaint as FIR and take\r\n\r\nnecessary action against the abovenamed persons and kindly oblige.\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-08','14:46:00','PRITAM DAS,	15/2/11 BANK PLOT JHEEL ROAD, SWEETLAND, JADAVPUR, P.S-GARFA, KOL-700075.',3,'FORWARDED TO CYBER CRIME PS, BARRACKPORE AS PER JURISDICTION.  \r\n','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:3:{i:0;s:45:\"Contacted and advice given to the Complainant\";i:1;s:40:\"Contacted with alleged person and warned\";i:2;s:14:\"Petition filed\";}','Yes',NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Yes','2022-01-17',NULL,'2022-01-20 14:10:00',1,45),(242,'Written','Cyber PS, LP complaint no-33/22',3,'','The complainant lodged a complaint rehading an unknown miscreant of whatsapp no- 9830847204 harassed and blackmailed him followed by extortion after capturing videos/images of his private parts without his consent\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-09','14:48:00','DEBASHRI BHOWMIK ROY CHAUDHURY,,  	JAGAT ROY CHOWDHURY ROAD, P.O-BARISHA, P.S-THAKURPUKUR, KOLKATA-700008 ',10,'Contacted the complainant and take the details.\r\nSend a letter to WhatsApp to get the details of the use.\r\nReply awaited.','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:2:{i:0;s:45:\"Contacted and advice given to the Complainant\";i:1;s:35:\"Letter send to the intermediataries\";}','No',NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes','2022-01-10',NULL,'2022-01-20 22:56:00',1,45),(243,'Written','Cyber PS, LP complaint no-34/22',3,'','The complainant lodged a complaint regarding receiving ABUSING MESSAGES THROUGH INSTAGRAM vide URl: https://www.instagram.com/8053seema?utm-medium= , BY AN UNKNOWN MISCREANT AND RECIEVED ABUSIVE MESSAGES.\r\n','2022-08-01','05:30:00','2022-01-09','18:52:00','DUSHYART PATEL',10,'Contacted the complainant and take the details.\r\nSend a letter to Instagram to get the details of the use.\r\nDo some social engg to get the details of the user.\r\nReply awaited.

Hope you are well and staying safe in this pandemic and taking care of your people. And Police Officers too.\r\nI would like to report a massive scam that took place with me. The scammers are from Kolkata.\r\nIt began with them over refunding money for  a computer program that I didn\'t order.  ($399.99) They made me believe that I would be getting a refund. They asked me to turn on the computer and download a remote control program ( that\'s how they controlled my PC) and then they asked me login my bank account in order to get refund so I did. From there, they also locked my computer so I could not check my bank account.\r\n\r\nThen they hacked my business bank account that they refunded $39,999.99 that was added to my account ( Which was all lies ).Then I sent wire transfers to them. They scared me into believing that I would go to jail if I didn\'t pay them back. It was never their money.  It was my business ( Business Name : AlphaGeek Service) account.\r\nI have a partner in India who is helping me to recover this money that was scammed from me .  He will also help in investigating this case with the Police officer. I have requested him to visit Kolkata. The money belongs to both partners. Eventually they scammed over $150,000.00 from my business account. I am hoping that you as a Chief Minister of the State and Cyber Police will help to recover the money.\r\n\r\nI am so devastated that I have lost my business. It is my business partner in India and you are our last hope to help recover the money.  I think about this situation daily and it is so stressful.  My name is Susan Jarvie and my business partner Nehal from India, ( I call him Jamie). He shared with me that you are the Best Chief Minister and as a woman, you will understand my situation,  how serious for a woman like me to have lost all of this money. I would like you to assign my case to your best Cyber Police officer to recover my money back as soon as possible.\r\nI have requested my business partner to visit Kolkata in person and share the details of this case with the Cyber Police officer.  He will be there in about a week to share bank details that are being used to receive the wire transfer from USA to Kolkata. We would do our best to assist the Cyber Police officers in order to recover the money.\r\nI am looking forward to your response.\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2021-08-08','00:34:00','SUSAN JARVIE',2,'This is an allegation against fake call centre. enquiry is on progress.','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:1:{i:0;s:41:\"Social engineering initiated and fixed up\";}','No',NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01',NULL,'2022-01-20 17:15:00',1,45),(542,'Written','Cyber PS, Kolkata CM/CP No-624/21, dated - 24.11.2021',15,'','OLX-FRAUD\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2021-11-24','15:34:00','SANIB KUMAR ROY,BEHALA, KOLKATA-34, 45A, AGARWALA GARDEN ROAD, KOL-38, M-8013545756',4,'SENT TO ABFS,DD ON 30-11-2021\r\n','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:1:{i:0;s:45:\"Contacted and advice given to the Complainant\";}','Yes',NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01',NULL,'2022-01-20 11:45:00',1,45),(543,'Written','Cyber PS, Kolkata CMCP 625/21, dated - 24.11.2021',18,'','BANK FRAUD\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2021-11-24','14:15:00','ANSHUMAN SHARMA,HAPPY HOURS TRAVELS KOLKATA, M-9830282388',3,'SENT TO CYBER CRIME PS BIDHANNAGAR P.C.

Thereafter I requested her to delete the said video but she started demanding for Rs 15,000/- more and threatened me that I do not immediately send her the amount then she will send the video to all my contact and shall upload the same on youtube, under fear of losing reputation I sent her another Rs 15,000 even after that she threatening me and demanded to give her more Rs 20,000 I under coercion and to save my and my family reputation further gave her Rs 20,000. All the three transfer i.e transfer of Rs 2000, Rs15,000 and Rs 20,000 was made in UPI Id 8403095448 (PayTM) linked with IDFC First Bank being account no. 6719 and the said account is in the name of one Ashok Kr Khushwaha.\r\nThe above mentioned user of WhatsApp no. 8099246584 made further demands but I then blocked the said whatsapp no. and also unfriend her from my facebook account.\r\nShe then again messaged me on my WhatsApp from 9616959379 and started demanding more money from me I then again blocked that number as well.\r\nAfter sometime I received a call from 8134936708 and the person calling represented himself as Vikram Singh Rathore an officer from cyber crime branch. He told me that my video is pending in YouTube with a nudity content and as such I must immediately contact one Rahul Sharma of YouTube on 9394884349.\r\nThereafter I contacted said Rahul Sharma on 9394884349 and requested him to delete the abovementioned doctored video and to do the same he coerced me to pay him Rs. 63,600 in total which was transferred in savings account of one Ankit Shrivastav being account no. 50100474377811 in HDFC Bank, Agra Cantonment Branch.\r\nSir, the users of above mentioned WhatsApp numbers, Mobile Numbers and Account numbers have dishonestly induced me to deliver a total sum of Rs 1,00,600 by putting me under fear of injuring my reputation, by misusing social media. I thus request you treat this letter of complaint as FIR and immediately take strict and appropriate steps.\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2021-12-09','20:08:00','FAIZE RASHID ANSARI,29A RABINDRA SARANI KOL-73 ',7,'Enquiry has been started and letter has been sent to the concerned bank authority.

Recently I arrested two persons regarding a job cheating. On 10/10/2021 afternoon when I interrogated the accused  persons, the mastermind of the racket namely Rohan Agarwal stated that they have an office at Khiddirpore and four persons of that area engaged his rackets. To verify the statement I try to contact through video call on messenger with one of my Facebook friend namely Jaya Singh who is also a source of Police. One Male person received the call who is totally unknown to me and I cancelled the messenger call. After that the said person repeatedly called me through messenger. After sometime I received the said messenger call. He charged me why I called him on messenger. I disclosed my identity as SI of Police of DD Lalbazar and told him that I called Ms. Jaya Singh who is my Facebook friend and also the source of Police. He informed me that Jaya Singh is his wife who left his house along with his two sons due to affairs with one Naidu. He also charged me why I called him from Lalbazar in favor of the said Naidu. I told him that I don\'t know any Naidu and also told him that it is your family matter. After that I disconnect the said messenger call. \r\nOne 10/10/2021 night I come to know that the said Abheek chatterjee dishonestly and fraudulently uploaded a fake and misleading information with my pictures impersonating me in Social Media platform and falsely alleged against me that I create problem to their family life. He also used filthy language against me and kolkata police. The said activities of the said persons namely Abheek Chatterjee hampered my social dignity, damaged my reputation, positition and harrassed me, my family, friends and also the dignity of Kolkata Police.\r\nI request you to kind take necessary action against the said persons as per law.

This incident came to my knowledge only today when I had signed in to my outlook account to check my email. I suspect that on 15th December 2021 I had shared a word file to Mr Ritesh Bajaj who is my Professor of my college. In the same word file I had pasted a link of Bureau of Indian Standard from where I had made my reference for my dissertation. Immediately after sending the email to Mr Bajaj I found my outlook ID got infected by a malware virus and as a result  several auto-generated emails are getting circulated from my email ID which is asking for Investments through Bitcoin(screen shot2 is attached). I am  really surprised to see so many emails getting sent from my outlook email ID to various email addresses non-stop without my knowledge . However I had logged out of my outlook email that day (15th December 2021). Today when I logged in I found that the hacker has got my password which I had personally changed at the time of creation of my account. I am now scared that important data does not get transferred from my laptop.

How are you?\r\n\r\nI know, it\'s unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.\r\nFew months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.\r\nAfterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.\r\n\r\nHere is the history of how it could become possible:\r\nAt first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).\r\nAs result, I could easily log in to your email account (tuki078@rediffmail.com).\r\n\r\nOne week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.\r\nFrankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).\r\nEverything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!\r\n\r\nMy software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.\r\nI could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.\r\nI can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.\r\nVirus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.\r\n\r\nHence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.\r\n\r\nAs I was gathering information about you, I couldn\'t help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.\r\nYou actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.\r\nI could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.\r\n\r\nIf you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,\r\nit only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.\r\nI can also make those vids become accessible by public.\r\nI honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,\r\n(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:\r\nEverything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1390 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),\r\nand once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.\r\nAfter that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.\r\nMake no doubt that I will fulfill my part.\r\n\r\nThis is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.\r\nIf you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process - it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.\r\n\r\nHere is my bitcoin wallet provided below: 19Ya5oeV6zqsHa9TSyurpeF1LpYJqm84Yv\r\n\r\nYou should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:\r\n#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).\r\n#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.\r\n After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) - your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.\r\n#Do not try searching for me - there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.\r\n#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains things you should not be worried about:\r\n#That your money won\'t reach my account.\r\n- Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,\r\n I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).\r\n#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.\r\n- Trust me, it\'s pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!\r\n\r\nLet\'s make this deal in a fair manner!\r\n\r\nOwh, one more thing...in future it is best that you don\'t involve yourself in similar situations any longer!\r\nOne last advice from me - recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-17','09:35:00','Pradip Kumar Halder 130, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road PO-New Barrackpore North 24 Parganas, W.B.

I switched it off and after a few minutes it got switched on again, right infront of me.\r\n2. Once I was using airplane mode on my phone when suddenly the bluetooth icon turned on. It was very weird and I started feeling anxious. I tried turning it off but every single time it turned itself on. \r\n\r\nVague incidents:\r\nHere I\'ll try to explain what I see, what I comprehend and what I feel.\r\n\r\nFew months ago I started keeping my phone away from me, not using it as frequently as I used to. Switching off it at times and sometimes using the aeroplane mode. I have covered both the cameras of the phone (front and rear). The reason for doing all the above acts is - when I use social media, especially Instagram and Twitter, I see posts related to me. Everytime. \r\nLike some people doubted that Facebook is stealing their data by noticing a lot of ads related to their searches or conversations, similarly, I notice a lot of posts related to my daily activities. You may argue that I\'m overthinking.

His Holiness is a saint who is venerated by one and all irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. He is the 19th successor of His Holiness Hazrat Syedana Abdul Qader Al Jilani, who was the progenitor of the Qaderia Order, a Sufi Silsila (order), which is highly respected all over the world. His Holiness Hazrat Syedana Abdul Qader Al Jilani is the Greatest Saint of Islam and is highly respected by all the Sufi orders around the world. My forefathers migrated from Syria in the late 1800s, around 290 years back, and settled in Undivided Bengal to propagate this highly venerated order. And ever since they have held high regards in the hearts of the people of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The annual Urs Sharif of His Holiness Hazrat Syed Murshed Ali Al Qadri is celebrated in Medinipur on the 4th Falgun according to the Bengali calendar every year with a lot of pomp and grandeur. This Urs Sharif is attended by devotees from all over the world. A special train arrives every year from Bangladesh, carrying devotees from the other side of the border, who come to attend the Urs sharif, and this has been a tradition for over 120 years now. \r\n\r\nHowever, today with utmost regret I am writing this letter to you. It was brought to my notice by the devotees of the Qaderia order from all over Bengal that over the few days, one person on facebook by the name of \"Imtiaz Akbari/Allama Chisty\" is spewing venom on social media. He is using foul language and hurling abuses at the progenitor of the Qaderia Order and his successors, as well as to the \"Peer Sahabs\" of Medinipur, who are my forefathers and above all highly venerated Saints. We agree that there might be ideological or theological differences among the different sects and orders, but this kind of behavior is unacceptable and totally uncalled for. The said person claims to be a follower of Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz of Ajmer, however, we have been in talks with the members of the Chisty Order in Ajmer, and even they have disowned him and do not agree to anything he is saying. It seems as if it is a planned propaganda to cause disturbance in civil society and outrage the devotees of the Qaderia Order. What we can make out from his dialect in his speeches is that he is a native of either Bangladesh or off-the-border districts. He is using approximately 30 Facebook accounts with different present locations, to spread this venom, links of some of which have been included in this mail. Most of his posts are being reported on Facebook, some of which have been removed by Facebook, but most of them are still there. In the history of democratic India, which is home to the second-largest Muslim population in the World, there have never been sectarian clashes between the different sects of Islam. Using social media to abuse and defame such highly venerated Individuals is a disgusting activity, which should be looked into immediately. We would request you to kindly look into the matter and do the needful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and regards, \r\nSyed Marshood Ali Al Qadri, \r\nMember, \r\nWest Bengal Minorities Commission\r\nGovernment of West Bengal\r\n\r\n+91 9836042113\r\n+91 9800474017\r\n\r\n\r\nThe links of the various Facebook accounts:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allamachisti.azmerihussaini\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068749316046\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100070600868754\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063976451125\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068252856870\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks of the hate speeches and abuses:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100062915262921/videos/1879430338896591/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100062915262921/videos/649767103071485/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100068252856870/videos/103023221982773\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100070600868754/videos/392370119307558/\r\n',NULL,NULL,'2021-12-04','13:50:00','SYED MARSHOOD ALI AL QADRI',4,'As the complainant is residing under Birbhum district and hence it was SENT TO CYBER CRIME BIRBHUM DIST ON 11-12-2021 for further action at their end. \r\n','Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01','a:1:{i:0;s:45:\"Contacted and advice given to the Complainant\";}','Yes',NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Yes','2022-01-20',NULL,'2022-01-20 18:34:00',1,45),(1247,'eMail','CYBER PS KOLKATA EMAIL NO-1798/21 DT. 04-12-2021',19,'','The Officer in Charge,\r\nCyber Cell,\r\nKolkata Police Headquarters,\r\nLal Bazar.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\n      This is to bring to your notice that a person by the name of Imtiaz Chisti Akbari,  is uploading hate speeches against the greatest Saint of Islam His Holiness Huzur Hazrat Syedena GHAUSUL AZAM (Boro Pir Saheb (ra)), the founder of  Qadri Silsila (Sufi order),    under the name of Allama Chisti on Facebook.

Thereafter I requested her to delete the said video but she started demanding for Rs 15,000/- more and threatened me that I do not immediately send her the amount then she will send the video to all my contact and shall upload the same on youtube, under fear of losing reputation I sent her another Rs 15,000 even after that she threatening me and demanded to give her more Rs 20,000 I under coercion and to save my and my family reputation further gave her Rs 20,000. All the three transfer i.e transfer of Rs 2000, Rs15,000 and Rs 20,000 was made in UPI Id 8403095448 (PayTM) linked with IDFC First Bank being account no. 6719 and the said account is in the name of one Ashok Kr Khushwaha.\r\nThe above mentioned user of WhatsApp no. 8099246584 made further demands but I then blocked the said whatsapp no. and also unfriend her from my facebook account.\r\nShe then again messaged me on my WhatsApp from 9616959379 and started demanding more money from me I then again blocked that number as well.\r\nAfter sometime I received a call from 8134936708 and the person calling represented himself as Vikram Singh Rathore an officer from cyber crime branch. He told me that my video is pending in YouTube with a nudity content and as such I must immediately contact one Rahul Sharma of YouTube on 9394884349.\r\nThereafter I contacted said Rahul Sharma on 9394884349 and requested him to delete the abovementioned doctored video and to do the same he coerced me to pay him Rs. 63,600 in total which was transferred in savings account of one Ankit Shrivastav being account no. 50100474377811 in HDFC Bank, Agra Cantonment Branch.\r\nSir, the users of above mentioned WhatsApp numbers, Mobile Numbers and Account numbers have dishonestly induced me to deliver a total sum of Rs 1,00,600 by putting me under fear of injuring my reputation, by misusing social media. I thus request you treat this letter of complaint as FIR and immediately take strict and appropriate steps.',NULL,NULL,'2021-12-09','14:08:00','FAIZE RASHID ANSARI, 29A RABINDRA SARANI KOL-73 M-96744421826',7,'Enquiry has been started and letter has been sent to the concerned bank authority.

I am a Senior Citizen.\r\n For registering, they asked mob.no, then password. Since I had no previous password & there weren\'t any option for new password, I clicked on to \"forgot password\". An OTP would be sent via sms. There was no otp, but a msg from Airtel, saying that since they don\'t have my KYC, I will not get any OTP. Also, they will block my tel. After 24 hrs, if kyc is not done immediately. A mobile number was given, I called, the man said \"kindly Hindi mein boliyen.\" When I said I had ported from Airtel to Vodafone many years ago and pay bills from Voda, then why should I give kyc to Airtel...he explained some technical rules and said that KYC had to be done from Airtel itself. He kept on directing me till the page came to where I had to pay Rs.10/, online. The page appeared, and I refused to put in any detail of my card etc. Now he got sort of hyper and started insisting me to do that online payment of 10/. I hung off. He called again and I didnt take the call. All this was happening on this phone set. Within 5 mins a msg appeared on my other mobile(which I use for banking only) from SBI, sending an OTP for a transaction of 10/ for that particular site. Of course, I deleted the msg immediately, but was quite scared that they had got to know that I have a/c in SBI, my other mobile number and had sent such a msg. I called on the complaint number and SBI said that there was no chance of their sending any OTP, unless I request for one! They said that the message must be fraud.\r\nI wonder how from COWIN site I had been taken to the fraud site!\r\nSoon I tried to delete the COWIN site and the page where they had directed me to. My mobile deleted all, but not that page. The page kept flickering, often my screen got black etc. Finally, I managed to delete all that I wanted to.

The complain no was 22542. There was an illegal transaction made through UPI ID on phone pe app, from mobile number 8926091383. The incident was reported just within 2 hrs of the crime. The person’s no was active almost 2-3 weeks after the crime was done .. he kept on calling me and misleading me in several ways. I don’t think any action has been taken on it at all. The person kept on calling me from the same mobile from where the fraud transfer happened. I also went to the local police station which is Kasba PS to make an FIR as the transaction amount was too large adding to Rs 93,000.00 . The police station just recorded a GD instead of an FIR after keeping me waiting for more than 3 hrs. I had all the recorded conversations of the fraud person, but nothing was checked even if I insisted to show the proofs. When I wanted to follow up with cyber cell after a week, on +918585063104, I was very rudely said .. nothing can be done in such short time.. I need to wait for 20-22 days for the refund. And after waiting patiently for 22 days, when I called the above no today, I was said, the money has already been cashed out. I don’t really know how effectively the cyber cell team would work,, but for my case, I have seen there was no support at all from the police authority ..to check any evidence which could have been utilised in the right way to recover the money.. it’s getting too hard to keep trust on our police system honestly. When I kept on saying that the person’s no is active and he is constantly calling, not a single officer paid any head to that. I really have lost faith in our system long ago.. but this incident again made me realise how inefficient our administration is to get hold of these kind of frauds .. who are roaming freely everywhere and just making normal hard working human beings their prey every time. I am really shocked and shattered while I am making this complain, still knowing that there won’t be any action taken. Atleast a minimum effort from the team would have been highly appreciated and would have saved lives of normal people.. but I I really ashamed in the way the system works at the moment. Please let me know if there is any way how you can help me. The Police force has all the power and authority to save this nation from these kind of fraudulent activities.. can’t you please use your power and save the nation from the vultures ?\r\nCurrently I stay outside India, this incident happened from my mother’s account .

The incident has been mentioned below in detail with proper evidence for your ready reference.\r\n\r\nI had uploaded a free ad on OLX online to sell out my old teak wood double bed on 12th. Jan’2022 (AD Ref. ID 1671040108)\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I received a message on OLX app, some Abhishek Kumar wants to communicate with me regarding the purchase of that Bed. He had asked for my contact number.\r\n\r\nAfter providing the number I received 1st call from the phone number +91 8011635430 and the caller identified himself as Abhishek Kumar. He also said that he is the owner of a furniture shop at DumDum area under the name & style of Raju Furniture Shop. He negotiated the product price upto Rs. 9000/ (Rupees Nine Thousand) only.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the price he asked to share my current location on his whatsapp service on the same number +91 8011635430 to collect the product today.\r\n\r\nThen he requested to mark the published ad as ‘SOLD’ on the OLX app. On his request, I had done the same and now I discovered that the existing ad details vanished from the app because the particular product was marked as SOLD.\r\n\r\nThe person has told me that he will pay the upfront money from his PAYTM business account and that’s why I need to have my own PAYTM wallet. After getting confirmation from me on the same, he sent me a QR code on my whatsapp service number +91 7003614978 and instructed me to scan that particular QR code via my PAYTM app.\r\n\r\nFollowing his instruction, I scanned the QR code and Rs. 2/- (Rupees Two) only had been debited from my Bandhan Bank savings account Kankurgachi branch (A/c. No.50180008812459) which is linked with PAYTM wallet service to another PAYTM account registered with the name of Dhirender Kumar Singh. At the same time Rs 2/- (Rupees Two) only had been credited again to the same account from the mentioned PAYTM account of Dhirender Kumar Singh.\r\n\r\nAfter confirming the checking process as per instruction, Abhishek said that he has sent another QR code bearing the payment of Rs. 9000/- (Rupees Nine Thousand) only. He also instructed that, again, I have to follow the same procedure to receive the upfront money that he had already transferred to my PAYTM account.\r\n\r\nI disclosed to him that I don’t have sufficient money to receive Rs. 9000/ (Rupees Nine Thousand) only according to that procedure. Then he forced me to do the same process. I strictly refused to follow the process. Then he started using abusive language and started shouting at me over the phone, that he has already transferred the money and if I don’t receive that money, that is none of his headache. He threatened me that he will send his coolies to collect the product from my residence immediately. He also insisted me to attach another bank account to scan the QR code and to receive money that he has sent. (All call recordings are available and can be provided as proves if required.)\r\n\r\nI strongly denied to attach another account but due to his forcing I had transferred Rs. 9000/- (Rupees Nine Thousand) only from my HDFC bank Santoshpur branch account (A/c. No.50100279216558) to mentioned Bandhan Bank account (A/c. No.50180008812459) and had followed the process as he had instructed. Naturally Rs. 9000/ (Rupees Nine Thousand) only has been transferred to his PAYTM account which is registered under the name of Dhirender Kumar Singh  through QR code scan process but I didn’t receive back my money neither his upfront money which he demanded that he has already been transferred to me.\r\n\r\nI called him up again and briefed the matter. He insisted on me, rather than forcing me to transfer another Rs. 9000/ (Rupees Nine Thousand) only, because he linked his payment process with my google wallet. So, I need to pay another Rs. 9000/- (Rupees Nine Thousand) only from my Google Pay wallet to receive his money.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing that I had stopped communicating with him.\r\n\r\nToday I went to Manicktala Police station and placed a written complaint there. As advised by the duty officer, here I am informing you the same. The scan copy of the receipt is attached herewith. \r\n\r\nSir, I humbly request  you to do the needful to arrest these frauds and get back my hard earned money from them.\r\n\r\nHope, you will take prompt action to keep our good faith on Kolkata Police and oblige.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProdeep Kumar Bhattacharjee.\r\n\r\nDetails & Address:\r\n\r\nS/o.

My name is Suranjana Chatterjee wife of Abhijit Chattopadhyay residing at 42/214, New Ballygunge Road, P.S. Kasba, Kolkata - 700039;\r\n\r\n2. My husband is residing at Gauhati in connection with his service.\r\n\r\n3. I have two daughters named Abhipshita (Mobile NO 8240524206) and Sadrita( Moble No. 9903242323)\r\n\r\n4. Presently I  am residing at 42/214, New Ballygunge Road,P.S. Kasba, Kolkata - 700039 with my youngest daughter Sadrita.\r\n\r\n5. My eldest daughter Abhipshita Chatterjee got married on 21st November, 2016 to her colleague, Raju Mukherjee( Mobile No. 9674589136). Both of them was working in \'Bestseller Services and were attached to a store named \'ONLY\', in Forum Mall.\r\n\r\nPresently she is working in Mobel Furnitures as a visual merchandiser. 6. Abhipshita\'s husband Raju Mukherjee met with an accident in 2017. Since no one\r\n\r\nfrom Raju\'s Family were there, I and my husband spent around 4.5. Lakhs for his\r\ntreatment and for over a year, both he and my daughter used to live with us in our\r\n\r\nKasba residence 7. A year later, even after being declared physically fit by the doctor Raju refused to work. Raju being an idle guy not like working for gain.\r\n\r\n8. My daughter Abhipshita complaint to us that Raju used to exploit her both physically and mentally and further used to demand money from her from time to time.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nMy daughter declined to continue relationship with said Raju and finding no other\r\n\r\nalternative she came back to my house at Kasba and used to stay with me.\r\n\r\n10. In or about September, 21 genuinely suspected my daughter\'s entanglement with another married man named Ujjal Chakraborty (mobile no. 8100208905) ( married to Moushumi, having a son named Saunak). My daughter tried to introduce us with Ujjal and his son. I however declined to her proposal. She used to come late at night and when I asked about her whereabouts, she would put her official work as an excuse. During the Puja holidays we decided to leave for Darjeeling but she refused, claiming that her office colleagues together have decided to leave for Digha. We later came to know that she left for Digha with Ujjal, and from October onwards, she started living with him along with parents.\r\n\r\n11. I cannot give any indulgence to her and cautioned her that she has not obtained lawful divorce from Raju Mukherjee but she did not pay any heed to the same. For the last two months she would call at odd hours in the night, claiming that Ujjal is abusing her and hurling out of Ujjal\'s house, late at night became a common affair. In the morning however, things would be normal again and she would continue to live together with him.\r\n\r\n12. Meanwhile Ujjal\'s sister in law( sister of moushumi) Neha and some one related to Ujjal\'s wife, named Puja Dey sent threatening, derogatory comments in my name coupled with slut shaming my youngest daughter Sadrita on social media.\r\n13. Owing to such discard and with the object of defaming me and my youngest daughter the said Neha and his friend Puja had posted objectionable pictures on a social net work platform and had widely circulated such materials. It is stated that these are punishable offences under section 66E and 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\r\n\r\n14. In the last week my daughter informed me that Ujjal\'s parents are creating difficulties for both herself and Ujjal and that both of them have decided to shift to a rented house. We are not aware of the said address.\r\n\r\n15. I got my daughter\'s call on 31st night where she again complained about her problem with Ujjal and expressed her desire to come back to Kasba. I strongly declined to give\r\n\r\nany entry to her in my house.\r\n\r\nUnder the aforesaid facts and circumstances I would request you to take note of the aforesaid facts and to initiate appropriate proceeding against Neha and Puja including Cyber Crime proceeding under the Information Technology Act so that they might be adequately punished. An early action on your behalf is earnestly solicited.\r\n\r\nThanking you,',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-22','05:30:00','Suranjana Chatterjee',4,'The complainant was sent her complaint through speed post and did not submit any screen shots relating to her allegation.

I am Soumyen Chatterjee, aged about 57 years residing permanently in this city at 19, Sardar Shankar Road, Kolkata – 700029, P.S – Tollygunge, along with my wife Ms. Mousumi Chatterjee and my only son Mr. Sayan Chatterjee. I am an Electrical Engineer working in the capacity of General Manager, in CESC Limited, a reputed private company engaged in the business of distribution of electricity in the city of Kolkata and its suburbs. I have more than 35 years of experience of working in CESC Limited. I am a law abiding citizen of the country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.       I have interests in singing, video editing etc. while my wife has that in writing and recitation of poems as our hobby apart from our professional work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       I had launched a YouTube channel on 1st July, 2019 in the name and style of “SC Unlimited” (https://www.youtube.com/UCFcBe5ixmGtFORF4YSCKjvA) which has 835 subscribers as on date, and moderate viewership. The viewers are primarily my friends, family, colleagues and known acquaintances. The channel had been launched by me only for pure entertainment and not for any business interest. The videos uploaded in the channel include Tagore’s songs, Bengali and Hindi Modern Songs, Recitation and blogs on heterogeneous subjects, including travel videos. It may please be noted that none of my videos have any political connotation. Usually appreciative good comments are logged in the comment boxes of the videos by my friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would now let you know about a few derogatory and threat comments which has of late, started pouring in the comment boxes of my videos as below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.       A video on recitation of Buddhadeb Basu’s poem by my wife was uploaded in my channel under the title “কবি বুদ্ধদেব বসুর জোনাকি। আবৃত্তি – মৌসুমী” on 16th January, 2022. I observed a comment by one unknown person, Subhomoy Debnath claiming to be Block President of Dubrajpur which is reproduced here in its original form -\r\nSubhomoy Debnath \r\n\r\n • 8 days ago\r\n\r\n\r\nAmi Dubrajpur Block Sobhapoti apni apnar ei sob bondho korun noito bomb mere dibo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I was little worried about such comment, I did not reply to it with words. I only put a “Thumbs Down” in the reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.       I uploaded another video on a Tagore’s song sung by me on 23rd January 2022, titled যদি তোর ডাক শুনে কেউ না আসে। রবীন্দ্রসঙ্গীত। সৌম্যেন চ্যাটার্জী.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI found with utter surprise that a comment was posted by the same person – Subhomoy Debnath which is also reproduced verbatim –\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubhomoy Debnath \r\n\r\n • 1 day ago\r\n\r\n\r\nBondho korun ei sob. Ager video teo bolechilam. Ami dubrajpur block sobhapoti. Bomb mere uriye debo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be noted that two of my acquaintances have also posted appreciative comments against the above video – one by Ms. Nupur Lala and another by Ms. Sudeshna Chakraborty. Again in utter astonishment I observed that the above person i.e. Subhomoy Debnath replied to their comments with derogatory remarks. The chain of comments are also reproduced below for your kind reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNupur Lala (2 days ago)\r\n\r\n\r\nKhub bhalo ..',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-25','05:30:00','Soumyen Chatterjee',4,'The complainant did not provide link with screen shots of threatening messages and copy of his ID proof.

I switched it off and after a few minutes it got switched on again, right infront of me.\r\n2. Once I was using airplane mode on my phone when suddenly the bluetooth icon turned on. It was very weird and I started feeling anxious. I tried turning it off but every single time it turned itself on. \r\n\r\nVague incidents:\r\nHere I\'ll try to explain what I see, what I comprehend and what I feel.\r\n\r\nFew months ago I started keeping my phone away from me, not using it as frequently as I used to. Switching off it at times and sometimes using the aeroplane mode. I have covered both the cameras of the phone (front and rear). The reason for doing all the above acts is - when I use social media, especially Instagram and Twitter, I see posts related to me. Everytime. \r\nLike some people doubted that Facebook is stealing their data by noticing a lot of ads related to their searches or conversations, similarly, I notice a lot of posts related to my daily activities. You may argue that I\'m overthinking.

It was price d at INR 5,999/- and I was impressed with the offer and clicked on the inquiry button on the AD itself. The seller asked me to whatsapp him on 7047408361 (the entire whatsapp chat with this Alok Kumar Singh has been downloaded and attached as a pdf named as \"Quikr_Camera_Purchase_Fraud_Whatsapp_Chat-converted (1).pdf\") as to what I want. I selected this Nikon D5600 for purchase and asked him where he is located and he said he is located in Howrah and by the next day that is 28/01/2022 by 12 noon his delivery boy will deliver the product to me. This product has 28 days return and full refund policy, the product is one year old but never has been opened from the original box packing and they will give company warranty on this for 1 year and every camera I purchase from them. Also because of covid19 there shop is not open so I have to place the order by paying them via Phonpe and once Covid-19 is over I can even go to their shop in Howrah. This Alok Kumar Singh never gave the complete address of their shop and said that their shop is not the warehouse. Anyways I was impressed and asked Alok Singh if they have any Canon DSLR and they said they have Canon D200 as well for 4849/- with the same warranty and return clauses. I told them to pack both camera and they said next day 28/01/2022 by 12 o\' clock noon their delivery boy will deliver these two cameras if I pay them immediately INR 10,848/- via phonpe. made two phonpe transactions to Indal Kumar Mandal\'s phonpe number 82768559 and the Phonpe numbers are included in the whatsapp pdf file. Total amount paid was INR 10,848/- and this guy said he will send the invoice by 5pm evening 27/01/2022. However the product was not delivered on 28/01/2022 till 5pm evening and there was no invoice either. After literally chasing this Alok Singh I got the INCOMPLETE invoice (why INCOMPLETE ? because I paid another 2300/ next day for shipment also as this Alok SIngh demanded) around 9pm in the night 28/01/2022. Still no tracking ID was provided and Alok Singh dais their Kolkata shop did not have the cameras so that is why they had to ship the product from Gurgaon and that is why the delay. This guy charged me another INR 2300/- for shipment fro m Gurgaon and said by 29/01/2022 morning 11:30pm the produts will be delivered tpo me. By now I have already made a total phonpe amount of INR 13,148/- to Indal Kumar Mandal\'s phonepe number 82768559 . As usual on 29/01/2022 there was no delivery and after callin gthis Alok singh for nearly 20 times he started writing in the whatsapp that he is extremely busy with his Indal Kumar Mandal and can not talk. Again he demanded that I have to pay another INR 1860/- for extended warranty. While I originally booked this order on 27/01/2022 this Alok Singh never told me I have to pay extra money of 2300/- if there is no stock in Kolkata and also 1860/- for extended warrany and then I clearly mentioned in whatsapp that if they don\'t send the product I will report. After that I have been chasing this ALok Kumar SIng, thei Indal Kumar mandal and Konde office and they don\'t pick up the call and have not delivered the product. I want A FULL REFUND OF INR 13,148/- ASAP for whatever I paid to this seller/company whatever it is.

My husband\'s name Navojit Mukherjee. Been into a profession of ICSE and ISC Mathematics teacher for 12 years in St. Sebastian School and St. Patrick Day School.\r\nI have my Instagram professional account, id: @debjani256; for switching over my career to modeling and pageant shoots, suggested by my groomer Insternational Transqueen Pageant Winner, Ms Shaine Soni. I have 50K followers, among whom i can\'t pre-predict which person might turn to be harmful sometimes.\r\nSomeone from common followers list texted me few months back about a lady Instagram id: @tiothi2397 who has supposedly left her husband for extracting money from him regularly within a year of her marriage, claims herself as a model-actress, staying at Liluah. All information provided by the person claiming to be her husband\'s friend with his Instagram profile @framesbydev; reconfirming about gathering information about her on the request of her husband. I never texted back much, already finding something suspicious.\r\nJust 12 days back he again texted asking my whereabouts to which i replied casually about my well-being. Within 48 hours, suddenly he started texting about the common friend between me and Moon Saha, with whom this \'framesbydev\' were investigating about some affairs of Mrs. Moon Saha, that this close friend of mine might be planning to hack my bank account since phone number is known, asking to change laptop password, banking password everything. \r\nThe point is, I am not that tech savvy that how these links and password works, but what astounded me is what was the plan between this Dev and Moon Saha to play with mind of a layman lady, perturb my mind, traumatizing me. I fell ill since it made me terribly anxious about my financial security and suspect the close friend too. Although i had a conversation over phonecall and resolved the matter finally. Since he stays out of station now at Noida.\r\n   But as a humble civilian and a regular taxpayer,  i thought about bringing this terrible matter in front of the Cyber Cell suggested by my husband and Shri Madan Mitra da, so that myself or any other entity shouldn\'t be mentally harassed or traumatized further.\r\nI humbly beg you Sir, to investigate into the matter and close such harmful person\'s Instagram YouTube Facebook or any social media account -- @tiothi2397 and @framesbydev\r\n\r\nP.S.: Although they have an adorned profile, but local party office of Liluah has the information of the polyamorous character of this lady Mrs. Moon Saha right from her teenage till date, for which she\'s proceeding for her divorce within 1 year of marriage. I wouldn\'t have taken any personal interest if i wouldn\'t have suspected her to be the mastermind behind such texts by this person Dev. So, i suspect it must be an act of grudge against me, if she has had some affinity or affair with the friend of mine. Since Instagram has been deteriorating in terms of usage of the quality of people out here, as I\'ve observed during this pandemic period. And i\'m writing an Article named \"Covid Effect\" on the current situation over social media forum which might be published in ABP soon.\r\n\r\nSeeking help to save the mass from such unprecedented traumatic incidents further, cause a strict step of closure of their profile might be highlighted for alerting other instagram users, who\'re using it for fulfilling some personal nasty purpose only.\r\n\r\nMoreover, i\'ve been so shocked with the incident, that i immediately deleted the whole chat box and blocked @framesbydev. Since Instagram don\'t auto download like Watsapp, i\'ve no screenshots or anything left, as an alibi, extremely embarrassed for that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDebjani Mukherjee ','2022-02-17','05:30:00','2022-02-17','05:30:00','Debjani Mukherjee',3,'The matter is not related with Cyber Crime.\r\nAdvice given to the complainant.','Yes',NULL,0,'1970-01-01','a:2:{i:0;s:45:\"Contacted and advice given to the Complainant\";i:1;s:14:\"Petition filed\";}','Yes','3','Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,'1970-01-01',NULL,'2022-02-17 16:54:00',1,45),(1981,'eMail','N.A',16,'','The complainant Earam Zafar sent an e-mail to this P.S and alleged that his phone has been hacked including all applications, pan card, Aadhar card and bank details.\r\n\r\nSometime ago he took a loan from a mobile app. On due date one of the agent contacted him and asked to pay a late fine of 380 and gave 2 days time for full payment.
